"<p>Blocks are boxes of content that may be rendered into certain "
"regions of your web pages, for example, into sidebars. They are "
"usually generated automatically by modules, but administrators can "
"create blocks manually.</p>\n"
"<p>Only enabled blocks are shown. You can position blocks by "
"specifying which area of the page they should appear in (e.g., a "
"sidebar).  Highlighted labels on this page show the regions into which "
"blocks can be rendered. You can specify where within a region a block "
"will appear by adjusting its weight.</p>\n"
"<p>If you want certain blocks to disable themselves temporarily during "
"high server loads, check the \"Throttle\" box. You can configure the "
"auto-throttle on the <a href=\"@throttle\">throttle configuration "
"page</a> after having enabled the throttle module.</p>\n"
"<p>You can configure the behaviour of each block (for example, "
"specifying on which pages and for what users it will appear) by "
"clicking the \"configure\" link for each block.</p>"
